Run the game without iso file by "mounting" the directory to a drive (It should at least be after drive G: since the game checks for this) using the 'subst' command.

Run the following in Command Prompt:
subst <destination_drive_letter>: <path_to_PINKGEAR_directory>

ex:
subst H: C:\Users\User\Desktop\"PINKGEAR repo"\pink-gear-fan-translation-eng\game\PINKGEAR
