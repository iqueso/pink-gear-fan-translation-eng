# About
Pink Gear Collection is made with Macromedia Director 5. This translation works by modifying cast members in protected cast files (.cxt extension) using Director 5. We replace cast member images containing Japanese text with modified images containing English text. We then replace the original cast member file with our own cast member file. The game will play our new cast file after replacing the original cast file with it. This is possible because we can modify and view the protected cast files as if they were an unprotected cast file (.cst).

# Contributing
There are quite a few visual bugs throughout a playthrough of the game. Visual bugs include palette misassignments (which result in incorrectly colored text), and textbox sizing constraints (since Japanese text is on average more condensed than English text). If you encounter any issues when playing the game, feel free to leave an issue in this repository. There is also a Discord channel for this translation effort.

# Other Projects
There is an on/off effort to produce a similar fan translation for the second Roly-Polys game: *Roly-Polys' World Tour* (*ローリーポーリーズの世界旅行*, *Rōrīpōrīzu no sekai ryokō*). [Information on this translation effort can be found in this GitHub repository.](https://github.com/iqueso/rp2-fan-translation-eng)
