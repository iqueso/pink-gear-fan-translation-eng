# About
Pink Gear Collection is made with Macromedia Director 5. This translation works by modifying cast members in protected cast files (.cxt extension) using Director 5. We are replacing cast member images containing Japanese text with modified images with English text. We then replace the original cast member file (.cxt), with our own cast member file. The game will then play our new cast file after replacing the original cast file with it.
