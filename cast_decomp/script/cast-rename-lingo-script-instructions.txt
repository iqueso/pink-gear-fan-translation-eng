Lingo script for applying original cast names to modified casts.

Steps for replicating (Director 5)
1. Load in source cast (either unprotected original cast or decompiled) with original cast names.
2. Load in target cast (for instance, a cast that we have made image replacements for).
3. Paste the script in as a movie-level cast (it should not appear as a member in either of the loaded-in casts).
4. Replace the source cast name in the script with the source (decompiled or original (<cast_with_original_names> in script)). Replace the target cast name with your target cast name (<target_cast>).
5. Compile and run. Observe output and verify name changes.
6. Manually repeat for each cast.

Note: There is an issue with this script in its current state that results in an index out-of-bounds issue. This is due to the indexing in the loop. This could likely be resolved with using a "repeat with" loop rather than a "repeat for" loop.
